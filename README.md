# Bootleg Barkeep
## Abstract
Bootleg Barkeep is a Prohibition-era themed cocktail app that presents the user with the ability to search for cocktails by their base alcohol type, to see a given cocktails' ingredients and preparation instructions, and that provides the user with randomized suggestions of drinks to try.
## Project Background
This web application was developed for the Turing School of Software and Design's Mod 3 Stretch Tech project. Students were given license to research and implement a technology, not otherwise addressed within the program's curriculum, over the course of ten days. For this project, the contributors chose to integrate TypeScript, a type-safe superset of JavaScript.

Cocktail data for the project was accessed from the public [Cocktail DB API](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php).
